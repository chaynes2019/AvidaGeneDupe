        \textbf{Rate of adaptive evolution across a spectrum of task complexities, Poisson-distributed mutation.}
        \footnotesize
        Simple tasks (leftmost panels) require only one logic gate component.
        More complex tasks (rightmost panels) require up to five logic gate components.
        Compared to Figure \ref{fig:adaptive-evolution-rate}, which shows results with per-site mutation rates, the relative rate of adaptive evolution in long-genome control is diminished under Poisson-distributed treatment, where mutation count is not proportional to genome length.
        Error bands give 95\% CI, bootstrapped over 30 replicates per treatment.
        Data shown from second-phase experiments.
