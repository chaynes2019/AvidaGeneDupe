  \textbf{Slip-duplicated sites are overrepresented among \textit{de novo} coding sites for complex traits.}
  \footnotesize
  Distributions compare median enrichment of coding sites for novel tasks in slip-duplicated regions, normalized to neutral expectation.
  Values greater than 1 indicate that coding sites of novel traits occur more often in slip-duplicated regions compared to their background frequency.
  Significance of deviation from null expectation median value of 1.0 is indicated with * ($p < 0.05$), ** ($p < 0.01$), or *** ($p < 0.001$) (one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test).
  Data shown from second-phase experiments.
