  \caption{\textbf{Treatments preserving slip-duplicated content facilitate adaptive evolution.}
  \small Violin plot (left) shows number of adaptive traits evolved (``phenotypic adaptation score'') in final dominant genotypes.
  Time series (right) shows progression of phenotypic adaptation score along lineages of final dominant genotypes;
  color-coding corresponds to violin plots.
  Asterisk (*) markers indicate treatments with significantly higher phenotypic adaptation scores compared to baseline.
  Simulation time unit is ``updates,'' corresponding to evaluation of approximately 30 genome sites per organism.
